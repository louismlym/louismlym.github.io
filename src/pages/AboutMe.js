      a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.uw.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>.

      I developed passion in problem solving
      during my childhood, when I helped my family run an internet caf√©. Then, I got exposed to
      competitive programming in grade 10, where I attended Thailand Computing Olympiad training
      camp. Feeling amazed by the great impact of technologies and grateful of my opportunities
      to pursue computer science degree, I'd like to be a driving force in CS education, which
      was reflected through my teaching experiences both in Thailand and as a teaching assistant
      at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Paul G. Allen school</a> for
      7 quarters. Motivated
      by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals" target="_blank">Microsoft TEALS program</a>,
      I wish to be involved in education, even when working full-time, to expand opportunities in
      CS education, that I was once received, to diverse groups of students.
      <br/><br/>
      Coding is not the only thing that easily brought me
      into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow</a>. Dancing
      also brings me joys and reminds me that I can always achieve a better version of myself. I've learned
      to be vulnerable yet strong, experimental, and mindful from the dance community.
